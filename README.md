# Finance-Bot

I’ve developed a Python-based bot designed to assist with various finance and trading tasks using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This project includes features like trading algorithms, financial data retrieval, and analysis tools. The bot can provide relevant answers to finance and trading queries.

Key Highlights:

    •	Automated trading strategies
    •	Real-time financial data updates
    •	User-friendly interface
    •	Enhanced with RAG architecture for improved data handling

Tech Stack:

    •	Python
    •	LangChain
    •	Datastack AstraDB
    •	Flask
    •	OpenAI LLM

How to run?

```
git clone https://github.com/patelshehbaz/Finance-Bot.git
